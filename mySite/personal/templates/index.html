                        <hr />
                        <p>
                            Though I had always been fascinated by coding since I was a young child, I quickly realized
                            that my
                            skills
                            were more
                            technical in nature after starting my career in 2009 as a graphic designer. After witnessing
                            the
                            creation of
                            a very
                            basic website, I fell in love. After that, I was like a dog without a bone, searching for my
                            next
                            move.
                            I
                            switched my
                            attention from learning front-end to back-end development. With the introduction of new
                            languages, I
                            kept
                            learning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to my genuine enjoyment of web/app development, multimedia, and design, I possess a
                            clear,
                            logical
                            mind,
                            a practical
                            approach to problem solving, and the drive to see things through to completion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I'm eager to overcome challenges and have a sharp eye for detail, it's easier to accept
                            criticism
                            and
                            learn from my
                            mistakes when I have an open mind. I've built databases and websites successfully in the
                            past, and I
                            can
                            work both
                            independently and cooperatively. In addition to having excellent technical and people
                            skills, I am
                            open
                            to
                            challenges
                            that will help me grow and learn new things.
                        </p>

                            I have over 8 years of experience as a professional full-stack developer, and I have also
                            built
                            mobile
                            apps
                            and
                            developed my Android engineering skills.
